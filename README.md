# 🏛️ Project Agorà: AI-Human Co-working Framework

## Overview
**Agorà** is a research framework within the *Carborundum* project. It explores advanced collaboration between a Human Architect (GM) and a multi-agent AI party. Using a **Video Game Metaphor**, we define specific roles, skills, and communication protocols to optimize synergy between different Large Language Models (LLMs).

## 🛡️ The Party (Core Architecture)
To avoid reductionism and maximize efficiency, the system operates through specialized classes:

* **The Architect (Claude):** Planning, quest decomposition, and structural integrity.
* **The Realizer (DeepSeek/Qwen):** Technical execution, clean coding, and automation.
* **The Reviewer (GPT):** Quality assurance, stress-testing, and risk analysis.
* **The Support (Gemini):** Context maintenance, documentation, and data retrieval.

## 📜 Ethical & Privacy Protocol
* **Anonymization:** No real-world human user names are stored in this repository. All end-users are referred to by codenames (e.g., *EndUser_Alpha*).
* **Security:** API keys, credentials, and sensitive business logic are handled outside this public repository.
* **Transparency:** The methodology is public to foster open research in AI-Human interaction.

## 📈 Status
The project is currently in **Phase 2: Multi-Agent Automation**. We are synchronizing communication protocols between different LLM instances using GitHub as a centralized "source of truth" for project status and rules.
